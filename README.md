# ruler
This is simple web app that I use to measure 📐  length(px).
...designed with no canvas 😱.
let's Check ☑ it out...

<mark>Usage:</mark><br>
i. You can use the application by adding the <i>~ruler.js</i> path to your html script tag,<br>
Then, add this event listener 👉  "onload="menu()"" to your html body tag.<br>
ii. Or directly by launching the <i>ruler.html</i> file. <br><br>
Nb: It's most compatible with desktop browser.

  HAVE FUN 😂
