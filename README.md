# ruler
This is simple web app that I use to measure 📐  length(px).
...designed with no canvas 😱.
let's Check ☑ it out...

<mark>Usage:</mark><br>
You can use the application by adding the <i>~ruler.js</i> path to your html script tag.<br>
Or directly by launching the <i>ruler.html</i> file. <br>
Finally, add this 👉 event listener <b>"onload="menu()""</b> to your html <code>"<body></body>"</code> tag<br>

Nb: It's most compatible with desktop browser.

  HAVE FUN 😂
