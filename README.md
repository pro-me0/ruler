# ruler
This is simple web app that I use to measure 📐  length(px).
...designed with no canvas 😱.
let's Check ☑ it out...

Usage:
You can use the application by adding the ~ruler.js path to your html script tag 
Or directly by launching the <i>ruler.html<i> file.
Finally, add this 👉 event listener <b>"onload="menu()""</b> to your html body tag

Nb: It's most compatible with desktop browser.

  HAVE FUN 😂
